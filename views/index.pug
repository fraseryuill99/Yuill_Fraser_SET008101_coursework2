      h3 KeyPhrase Encryption
      p#p3
        | In cryptography, a key phrase cipher (a.k.a substitution cipher) is a method of encrypting by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system;
        | the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by
        | performing the inverse substitution.
        | Substitution ciphers can be compared with transposition ciphers. In a transposition cipher, the units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually quite
        | complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged. By contrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are retained in the same sequence in the
        | ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered.
        | There are a number of different types of substitution cipher. If the cipher operates on single letters, it is termed a simple substitution cipher; a cipher that operates
        | on larger groups of letters is termed polygraphic. A monoalphabetic cipher uses fixed substitution over the entire message, whereas a polyalphabetic cipher uses a number
        | of substitutions at different positions in the message, where a unit from the plaintext is mapped to one of several possibilities in the ciphertext and vice versa.
      h4 Baconian Encryption
      p#p4
        | bacons cipher or the Baconian cipher is a method of steganography (a method of hiding a secret message as opposed to just a cipher) devised by Francis Bacon in 1605. A message
        | is concealed in the presentation of text, rather than its content.
        | To encode a message, each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a group of five of the letters 'A' or 'B' (or 5 numbers '1' or '0'). This replacement is a binary encoding and is done according to
        | the alphabet of the Baconian cipher (from the Latin Alphabet).
      h5 Morse Code Encryption
      p#p5
        | Morse code is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes or dits
        | and dahs. Morse code is named for Samuel F. B. Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.
        | Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the
        | duration of a dot. Each dot or dash within a character is followed by period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration
        | equal to three dots, and the words are separated by a space equal to seven dots.
